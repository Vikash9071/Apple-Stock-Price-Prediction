#  Apple Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast Apple's (AAPL) stock prices based on historical data. LSTM is well-suited for time-series prediction due to its ability to retain long-term dependencies.

##  Project Objective

Predict future Apple stock prices using past stock data with an LSTM deep learning model
